# Atmospheric Rivers

This repository contains a variety of scripts for analyzing real-time model data (GFS) and model reanalysis data (ERA5). The focus is on Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT) and Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) for the GFS, and Theta-E Gradients for ERA5.

## Repository Structure

- **ERA5/**
  - `mfw_thetae_gradient.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing Theta-E Gradients using ERA5 reanalysis data.

- **GFS/**
  - `ivt.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT) using GFS real-time model data.
  - `iwv.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) using GFS real-time model data.
